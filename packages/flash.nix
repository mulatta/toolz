      FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is a very fast and accurate
      software tool to merge paired-end reads from next-generation sequencing
      experiments. FLASH is designed to merge pairs of reads when the original
      DNA fragments are shorter than twice the length of reads.
