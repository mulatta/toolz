      Jellyfish is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in DNA.
      A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences of all
      such substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA sequence.
      Jellyfish can count k-mers using an order of magnitude less memory and
      an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer counting packages by using
      an efficient encoding of a hash table and by exploiting the compare-and-swap
      CPU instruction to increase parallelism.
